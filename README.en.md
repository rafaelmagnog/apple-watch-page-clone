A project developed as part of the **JavaScript Intensive Course** by [Hashtag Dev](https://www.hashtagtreinamentos.com/).
This project recreates, in a didactic and interactive way, the **Apple Watch product page**, simulating the browsing experience of Apple’s official store.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this project was to **practice fundamental concepts of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**, applying them to build a faithful and responsive interface inspired by Apple’s website.
Throughout development, the following skills were explored:

* **DOM manipulation** using `querySelector` and `classList`;
* Dynamic updates of elements and images based on user interaction;
* Use of **inputs and labels** to create visual color and size selectors;
* Focus on **design, usability, and microinteractions**.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **HTML5** — Page structure and semantics
* **CSS3 (modern)** — Responsive layout, flexbox, nested selectors, and visual effects
* **JavaScript (ES6)** — Interaction logic, DOM manipulation, and dynamic updates

## 💻 Features

* 🎨 **Color selection** — Users can choose between 5 color options, and the gallery dynamically changes.
* ⌚ **Size selection** — Switch between 41mm and 45mm with visual feedback in the title and product scale.
* 🖼️ **Synchronized gallery** — Each color has its own set of images; clicking on a thumbnail updates the main image.
* 🪶 **Interactivity & UX** — Visual feedback when selecting color, size, or image, maintaining Apple’s usability standards.

## 🖼️ Interface

The interface was designed with **minimalism, clarity, and visual fidelity**, directly inspired by the Apple Store’s design.
Key aspects include:

* Centered, fluid layout (Flexbox)
* **San Francisco** typography to emulate Apple’s signature look
* Subtle **hover effects** on icons and buttons
* **Neutral and white tones**, with balanced spacing
